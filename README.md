# libft
The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that will be used in all future projects.

You can see this project as a "42 version" of libc, where a set of libc functions are recoded, as defined in their
man. These functions present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals, and their names are prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes
ft_strlen.

The library also includes a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form, as well as functions to manipulate linked lists.
